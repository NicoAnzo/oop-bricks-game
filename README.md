## How to play:

The player controls a paddle, moving it from side to side in order to hit a ball into a wall of bricks and destroy them. If all bricks have been destroyed, the player wins. If the ball touches the bottom edge of the game area, it's game over.


## Demo:

You can see [here](https://nicoanzo.github.io/oop-bricks-game/) the final version of the project.
